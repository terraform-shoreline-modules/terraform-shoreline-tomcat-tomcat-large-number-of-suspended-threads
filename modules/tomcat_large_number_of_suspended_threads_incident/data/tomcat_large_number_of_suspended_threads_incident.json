  "description": "In software engineering, a large number of suspended threads in Tomcat is an incident type that occurs when a high number of threads are created but are blocked from executing. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, such as slow database queries, network latency, or resource contention. When this occurs, the system may become unresponsive or slow, causing a degradation in performance or even a complete system failure. It is important to investigate and resolve this issue as quickly as possible to ensure the system can continue to function properly.",
